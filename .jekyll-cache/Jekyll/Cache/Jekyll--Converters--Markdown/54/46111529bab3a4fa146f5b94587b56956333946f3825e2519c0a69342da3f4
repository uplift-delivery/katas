<h3 id="requirements-specification">Requirements Specification</h3>

<p>Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a
prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods.
Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We
have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named
Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures. Your task is to add the new feature to our system so that
we can begin selling a new category of items. First an introduction to our system:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item
- All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
- At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
- The Quality of an item is never negative
- "Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets
- The Quality of an item is never more than 50
- "Sulfuras", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
- "Backstage passes", like aged brie, increases in Quality as its SellIn value approaches;
- Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but
- Quality drops to 0 after the concert
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- "Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Feel free to make any changes to the UpdateQuality method and add any new code as long as everything
still works correctly.</p>

<p>Just for clarification, an item can never have its Quality increase above 50, however ‚ÄúSulfuras‚Äù is a
legendary item and as such its Quality is 80 and it never alters.</p>

<p>In this version you can change any of the code you would like.<br />
We have vanquished the goblin developer that didn‚Äôt believe in collective code ownership</p>
