# üìã Insurance Claims Processing Kata

## The Problem

You‚Äôve been asked to implement the core logic for an insurance claims processing system. The system should evaluate incoming claims based on a variety of conditions, apply business rules, and calculate payouts accordingly. This challenge will involve complex decision trees and layered conditionals‚Äîideal for exercising clean logic, test coverage, and thoughtful modeling.

## Business Requirements

### Submitting a Claim

**As a** person with insurance, **I want** to submit a claim with incident details, **so that** it can be reviewed and processed.

Each claim has:
- `policyId`
- `incidentType` (e.g., accident, theft, fire, water damage)
- `incidentDate`
- `amountClaimed`
- `description`

### Evaluating a Claim

**As a** claims system, **I want** to evaluate incoming claims, **so that** we can approve, deny, or escalate them.

Apply the following rules:
- Check if the policy is active on the incident date
- Some incident types (e.g. theft) require a police report
- Claims above $10,000 must be escalated for manual review
- Certain policy types (e.g. ‚Äúbasic‚Äù) don‚Äôt cover some incident types
- Deductibles should be subtracted from the claim payout

### Calculating Payout

**As a** claims system, **I want** to determine how much to reimburse, **so that** customers are paid fairly.

- A valid claim results in a payout equal to `amountClaimed - deductible`
- The payout cannot exceed the policy‚Äôs coverage limit
- If the remaining balance is less than zero, payout is $0
- Store the payout decision with a reason code

### Claims History & Limits

**As a** person with insurance, **I want** to see how much I've claimed, **so that** I know my coverage usage.

- Total claim amount should not exceed the policy‚Äôs coverage limit
- The system should track total claimed vs. remaining coverage
