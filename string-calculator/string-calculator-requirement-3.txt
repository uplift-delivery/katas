3. Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).
	1. the following input is ok: “1\n2,3” (will equal 6)
	2. the following input is NOT ok: “1,\n” (not need to prove it - just clarifying)

Requirements:

	When I calculate the sum of "5\n11"
	Then I should receive 16
  
	When I calculate the sum of "3,17\n12"
	Then I should receive 32

	Hints:
	——————
	 - Start with the simplest test case
	 - Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about
	 - Remember to refactor after each passing test
         - This is an open internet exercise
