1. Create a simple String calculator with a method signature:
	———————————————
	int Add(string numbers)
	———————————————
	The method can take up to two numbers in a single string, separated by commas, and will return their sum. for example “” or “1” or “1,2” as inputs. (for an empty string it will return 0) 
	
	When I calculate the sum of ""
	Then I should receive 0
	
	When I calculate the sum of "3"
	Then I should receive 3
	
	When I calculate the sum of "5,11"
	Then I should receive 16
	
	Hints:
	——————
	 - Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to one and two numbers
	 - Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about
	 - Remember to refactor after each passing test
