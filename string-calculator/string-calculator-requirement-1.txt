1. Create a simple String calculator with the below method signature that takes in a string of up to two comma seperated numbers and returns the sum of those numbers.
	———————————————
	int Add(string numbers)
	———————————————
	
	Requirements: 
	
	When I calculate the sum of ""
	Then I should receive 0
	
	When I calculate the sum of "3"
	Then I should receive 3
	
	When I calculate the sum of "5,11"
	Then I should receive 16
	
	Hints:
	——————
	 - Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to one and two numbers
	 - Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about
	 - Remember to refactor after each passing test
