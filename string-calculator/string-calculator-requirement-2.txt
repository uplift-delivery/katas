Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers

When given a string with an unknown number of elements
Then the sum of those elements is returned

Requirements:

	When I calculate the sum of "1,2,3"
	Then I should receive 6
  
	When I calculate the sum of "1,2,3,9,3,4,2,4,3,3"
	Then I should receive 34


	Hints:
	——————
	 - Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to one and two numbers
	 - Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about
	 - Remember to refactor after each passing test
