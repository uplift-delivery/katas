5. Calling Add with a negative number will throw an exception “negatives not allowed” - and the negative that was passed. If there are multiple negatives, show all of them in the exception message.


Requirements:

	When I calculate the sum of "3,-11"
	Then I should throw an exception "negatives not allowed"
  
	When I calculate the sum of "-1"
	Then I should throw an exception "negatives not allowed"
  
	When I calculate the sum of "\\;\n12;-1"
	Then I should throw an exception "negatives not allowed"

	Hints:
	——————
	 - Start with the simplest test case
	 - Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about
	 - Remember to refactor after each passing test
   - This is an open internet exercise
