4. Support different delimiters
    1. to change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: “//[delimiter]\n[numbers…]” for example “//;\n1;2” should return three where the default delimiter is ‘;’ 
    2. the first line is optional. all existing scenarios should still be supported

Requirements:

	When I calculate the sum of "//c\n3c11"
	Then I should receive 14
  
	When I calculate the sum of "//;\n3;17\n12,2"
	Then I should receive 34

	Hints:
	——————
	 - Start with the simplest test case
	 - Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about
	 - Remember to refactor after each passing test
         - This is an open internet exercise
