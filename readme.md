# Why should we care about Code Katas?

Think of your favorite musician, artist, athlete, etc. How do you think that person become great at what they do?
All people that have become great or expert at anything have dedicated huge amounts of time to practicing their craft.
Pianists spend countless hours practicing their scales so that their fingers move swiftly without thought during their
concerts. Athletes spend countless hours in the gym, weight room, pool, etc. so that when the game/meet starts they are ready
to perform at their peak for a few hours. To be great or even good at anything requires some amount of practice.
There is no way around this; without practice skill does not improve.

A code kata is one form of practice. Have you ever wanted to learn TDD, CI, Refactoring, keyboard shortcuts, etc? 
Code katas can be a great safe way to improve or learn all of these skills.

## What is a Kata?

"Kata" comes from the world of martial arts. The goal of a kata in martial
arts is to practice a form multiple times making small improvements each time.

## What does that have to do with Software Development?

Software developers can use "code katas" as a form of practice. The idea is to 
choose a "code kata", spend 30 minutes to an hour working on the kata, and then reflect
on how they might do it differently. The most important part is the reflection. Performing
a kata without self-reflection will yield minimal actual improvement.
